### Fix permissions

# third-party providers. First ensure add-apt-repository is installed.

# come from there and minimal Ubuntu installs may have it turned off.

hide_output add-apt-repository -y ppa:certbot/certbot

# ### Update Packages

# Update system packages to make sure we have the latest upstream versions
# of things from Ubuntu, as well as the directory of packages provide by the
# PPAs so we can install those packages later.

echo Updating system packages...
hide_output apt-get update

# changes there may be other packages that are no longer needed. Clear out anything apt knows
# is safe to delete.

# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities.
#
# * haveged: Provides extra entropy to /dev/random so it doesn't stall
#           when generating random numbers for private keys (e.g. during
#           ldns-keygen).
# * unattended-upgrades: Apt tool to install security updates automatically.
# * cron: Runs background processes periodically.
# * ntp: keeps the system time correct
# * fail2ban: scans log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocks the remote IP at the firewall
# * netcat-openbsd: `nc` command line networking tool
# * git: we install some things directly from github
# * sudo: allows privileged users to execute commands as root without being root
# * coreutils: includes `nproc` tool to report number of processors, mktemp
# * bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults
# * openssh-client: provides ssh-keygen

# ### Suppress Upgrade Prompts

### Set the system timezone

# ### Seed /dev/urandom

echo Initializing system random number generator...
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=32 2> /dev/null

# This is supposedly sufficient. But because we're not sure if hardware entropy
# is really any good on virtualized systems, we'll also seed from Ubuntu's
# pollinate servers:

pollinate  -q -r

### Add ssh key

# ### Package maintenance

# Allow apt to install system updates automatically every day.
