# ### Install System Packages

# Install basic utilities.
#
# * haveged: Provides extra entropy to /dev/random so it doesn't stall
#           when generating random numbers for private keys (e.g. during
#           ldns-keygen).
# * unattended-upgrades: Apt tool to install security updates automatically.
# * cron: Runs background processes periodically.
# * ntp: keeps the system time correct
# * fail2ban: scans log files for repeated failed login attempts and blocks the remote IP at the firewall
# * netcat-openbsd: `nc` command line networking tool
# * git: we install some things directly from github
# * sudo: allows privileged users to execute commands as root without being root
# * coreutils: includes `nproc` tool to report number of processors, mktemp
# * bc: allows us to do math to compute sane defaults
# * openssh-client: provides ssh-keygen

# ### Local DNS Service

# Install a local recursive DNS server --- i.e. for DNS queries made by
# local services running on this machine.
#
# (This is unrelated to the box's public, non-recursive DNS server that
# answers remote queries about domain names hosted on this box. For that
# see dns.sh.)
#
# The default systemd-resolved service provides local DNS name resolution. By default it
# is a recursive stub nameserver, which means it simply relays requests to an
# external nameserver, usually provided by your ISP or configured in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.
#
# This won't work for us for three reasons.
#
# 1) We have higher security goals --- we want DNSSEC to be enforced on all
#    DNS queries (some upstream DNS servers do, some don't).
# 2) We will configure postfix to use DANE, which uses DNSSEC to find TLS
#    certificates for remote servers. DNSSEC validation *must* be performed
#    locally because we can't trust an unencrypted connection to an external
#    DNS server.
# 3) DNS-based mail server blacklists (RBLs) typically block large ISP
#    DNS servers because they only provide free data to small users. Since
#    we use RBLs to block incoming mail from blacklisted IP addresses,
#    we have to run our own DNS server. See #1424.
#
# systemd-resolved has a setting to perform local DNSSEC validation on all
# requests (in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, set DNSSEC=yes), but because it's
# a stub server the main part of a request still goes through an upstream
# DNS server, which won't work for RBLs. So we really need a local recursive
# nameserver.
#
# We'll install `bind9`, which as packaged for Ubuntu, has DNSSEC enabled by default via "dnssec-validation auto".
# We'll have it be bound to 127.0.0.1 so that it does not interfere with
# the public, recursive nameserver `nsd` bound to the public ethernet interfaces.
#
# About the settings:
#
# * Adding -4 to OPTIONS will have `bind9` not listen on IPv6 addresses
#   so that we're sure there's no conflict with nsd, our public domain
#   name server, on IPV6.
# * The listen-on directive in named.conf.options restricts `bind9` to
#   binding to the loopback interface instead of all interfaces.
apt_install bind9
edit_config /etc/default/bind9 \
  "OPTIONS=\"-u bind -4\""
if ! grep -q "listen-on " /etc/bind/named.conf.options; then
  # Add a listen-on directive if it doesn't exist inside the options block.
  sed -i "s/^}/\n\tlisten-on { 127.0.0.1; };\n}/" /etc/bind/named.conf.options
fi

# First we'll disable systemd-resolved's management of resolv.conf and its stub server.
# Breaking the symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf means
# systemd-resolved will read it for DNS servers to use. Put in 127.0.0.1,
# which is where bind9 will be running. Obviously don't do this before
# installing bind9 or else apt won't be able to resolve a server to
# download bind9 from.
rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
edit_config /etc/systemd/resolved.conf DNSStubListener=no
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf

# Restart the DNS services.

# ### Fail2Ban Service

# Configure the Fail2Ban installation to prevent dumb bruce-force attacks against dovecot, postfix, ssh, etc.
rm -f /etc/fail2ban/jail.local # we used to use this file but don't anymore
rm -f /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/defaults-debian.conf # removes default config so we can manage all of fail2ban rules in one config
cat fail2ban/jails.conf \
  | sed "s/PUBLIC_IP/$PUBLIC_IP/g" \
  | sed "s#STORAGE_ROOT#$STORAGE_ROOT#" \
  > /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/wspecsbox.conf
cp -f fail2ban/filter.d/* /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/

# On first installation, the log files that the jails look at don't all exist.
# e.g., The roundcube error log isn't normally created until someone logs into
# Roundcube for the first time. This causes fail2ban to fail to start. Later
# scripts will ensure the files exist and then fail2ban is given another
# restart at the very end of setup.
restart_service fail2ban
